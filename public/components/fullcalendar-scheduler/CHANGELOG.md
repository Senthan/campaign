- dynamically refetch resources upon navigation (#12):
	- `refetchResourcesOnNavigate`

- made gulp-based build system consistent with core project
- as with the corresponding core project release, there was an internal refactor
  related to timing of rendering and firing handlers. calls to rerender the current

  instead, will execute after handler finishes.

- fix bug with scrollbars causing selection after the first (#192)
